            <q>Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. For some they
            come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon,
            never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes
            away in resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is
            the life of men.</q>

            <p>
            <q>Now, women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and
            remember everything they don't want to forget. The dream is the
            truth. Then they act and do things accordingly.</q>
